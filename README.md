# dotfiles

Since I am still in school and switch often between personal, school and work machines, it is nice to be able to set up all my different dev environments to be the same.

I use this to keep consistency between all my git and vim shortcuts.

There a 3 primary scripts for transferring the settings around:
* `setup_settings` - run this on any new machine to import initial settings
* `push_settings` - run this if new settings need to be pushed onto local machine
* `upload_settings` - run this if new local changes need to be uploaded back into the repo

Most of the settings and layouts I have were gathered from:
1. Co-workers
2. <https://dotfiles.github.io/>
