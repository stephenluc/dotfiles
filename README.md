# dotfiles

Since I am still in school and switch often between personal, school and work machines, it is nice to be able to set up all my different dev environments to be the same.

I use this to keep consistency between all my git and vim shortcuts.

There a 2 primary scripts:
* `setup_settings.sh` - run this on any new machine to import settings
* `upload_settings.sh` - run this if new local changes need to be uploaded back into this repo

Most of the settings and layouts I have were gathered from:
1. Co-workers
2. <https://dotfiles.github.io/>
